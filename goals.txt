MoneyField for donation amounts
NumberField
DateTimeField
Field validation (numberField, moneyField, etc)
Polish GUI behavior
Add "type" for worktrade
Bugfix: scroll functionality can get stuck in a weird position when removing items
Check for duplicate bike serials and issue a warning
Use _ to prefix implementation properties in classes

Long Term:
Document process for determining how and why to add a feature
Instant switch between spanish/english
Daily database backups to local and remote storage
Extensive documentation of code and design methodologies
Remote access for mechanic tasks using Google API and Google Docs
Human readable exports (for printing/archiving)
Standard machine-readable exports (for migrating away from this system)
Automated unit tests, with regression tests for fixed bugs
Integrated error reporting with trace and user comment

Suggestions From Others (To Prioritize):
add more than one bike during add new person
select from bikes or add another bike upon signin
