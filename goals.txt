Short Term/TODO:
Debug Mode (to circumvent authentication dialog, etc)
Mechanic's Toolbox:
	Close program
	Bike by serial number
	View Person (without signing them in)
	View shop occupants by date
Inhibit shutdown
"Sign Everybody Out And Shutdown" button

Medium Term/Cleanup:
Fix hours when signing person out (with more than 24 hrs, etc)
Figure out why occupants aren't flashing
Scroll to occupant when flashing
More functional alternative to timectrl (it sucks)
Additional validation for CSV import
MoneyField for donation amounts w/validation
NumberField w/validation
Add "type" for worktrade
Check for duplicate bike serials and issue a warning
Use _ to prefix implementation properties in classes
Keyboard mnemonics for controls/commands (ex: enter is an "OK" click)

Long Term:
Member/Not Member/Expired in view person and occupants list
Force DB recreation and reload on schema change
Polish GUI behavior
Document process for determining how and why to add a feature
Instant switch between spanish/english
Daily database backups to local and remote storage
Extensive documentation of code and design methodologies
Remote access for mechanic tasks using Google API and Google Docs
Human readable exports (for printing/archiving)
Standard machine-readable exports (for migrating away from this system)
Automated unit tests, with regression tests for fixed bugs
Integrated error reporting with trace and user comment

Suggestions From Others (To Prioritize):
add more than one bike during add new person
select from bikes or add another bike upon signin
tell you what you owe on signout
