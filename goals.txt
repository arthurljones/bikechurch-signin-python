Short Term/TODO:
Get "View Person" screen functional - shows bikes, visits, (membership info?)
Protect against attempting adding of duplicate entries in DB in new person screen
Get "Edit Person" screen working

Medium Term/Cleanup:
Polish GUI behavior
Switch to SQLAlchemy for database functionality
Bugfix: scroll functionality can get stuck in a weird position when removing items
Check for duplicate bike serials and issue a warning
Use _ to prefix implementation properties in classes

Long Term:
Instant switch between spanish/english
Daily database backups to local and remote storage
Extensive documentation of code and design methodologies
Remote access for mechanic tasks
Human readable exports (for printing/archiving)
Standard machine-readable exports (for migrating away from this system)
Automated unit tests, with regression tests for fixed bugs
Integrated error reporting with trace and user comment
